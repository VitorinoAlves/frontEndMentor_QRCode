## My process
For this project first I created the content first (the card) and then with the card created I worked on the position.

### Built with

- HTML5

### What I learned

border-radius: propriedade CSS que permite definir bordas arredondadas;
The impact of the display: flex, where the child divs do not behave as a block content and starts to behave as a flex item, where there a lot of options of how to organize the flex items.
